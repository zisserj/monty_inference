# monty_inference

Work done as part of undergrad project.

Files description:
- behavior_script.wbppl - BP script model impl. via probabilistic prog
- timing_net.py - BP script model impl. via bayesian networks
- monty2.wbppl - working, scalable Monty Hall simulation
- monty2_time.wbppl - same as above, but benchmarks time per door added
- monty_BN_and_comparison.ipynb - scalable network and benchmarks


Bin: experiments and past versions or code sections.
- guess_door.wbppl - testing WebPPL
- gera.wbppl - prototype written by Gera in 2020
- monty1.wbppl - first attempt at modeling
- monty3_obsData.wbppl - attempts to incorporate observations into inference
- stringToJson.js - parses game strings into dictionaries
